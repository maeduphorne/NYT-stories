## Introduction

New York Times Top Stories was a practice "Take Home" technical challenge assigned as a solo project in the fourth module of [Turing School](turing.edu). We were given an 8 hour time frame to complete the assignment. This project allowed me to utilize the New York Times API to plan, design and execute an app that lists articles and navigates to a more detailed view of the article's information. The app was also required to search, sort or filter articles. I chose to create a search bar so that the user is able to search for keywords in an article's title that they may be intersted in learning more about.

The goal of the project was to practice for real world technical interviews by solidifying React and JavaScript fundamentals. Due to the time frame, I was also forced to prioritize for meeting required expectations. This project demonstrates an understanding of hierarchy of information & an ability to produce clean code within a given time frame.

## Technologies
  - React
  - React Router
  - CSS/Sass
